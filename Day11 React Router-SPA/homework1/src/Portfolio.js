        Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British
        author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard,
        Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of
        whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The
        main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark
        wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing
        body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and
        Muggles (non-magical people).

        The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter
        franchise to expand with numerous derivative works, a travelling
        exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London
        that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates
        the series with new information and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off
        films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to
        Find Them, among many other developments. Themed attractions,
        collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been
        built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the
        world.
